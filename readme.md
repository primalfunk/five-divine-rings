# The Five Divine Rings

**The Five Divine Rings** is a turn-based strategy game inspired by Sun Tzu's *The Art of War*. Players battle for dominance using a combination of espionage, resource management, and strategic warfare on a procedurally generated map. The game focuses on the mastery of Sun Tzu's five key principles, or "rings," which players must use to outwit and defeat their opponents.

## Game Features

- **Procedurally Generated Map**: Every game begins with a unique map, ensuring a fresh and dynamic experience with each playthrough.
- **Turn-Based Strategy**: Players take turns to execute their plans, manage their resources, and outmaneuver their rivals.
- **Player Resources**: Manage essential resources like Gold and Intel to expand influence and execute espionage missions.
- **Espionage System**: Use spies to infiltrate, gather information, or sabotage enemy operations.
- **Action Points (AP)**: Each player has a limited pool of Action Points per turn, which determines how many moves or actions they can perform.
- **Multiplayer Battles**: Compete against AI or other players to conquer the most districts and control the map.

## Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Districts**: The map is divided into districts, each representing a strategic area. Players can gain control over districts, which contribute to their resources.
2. **Turn System**: Players alternate turns, using their AP to perform actions such as moving units, conducting espionage, or managing districts.
3. **Resource Management**: Gold and Intel are the key resources in the game. Gold allows for maintaining armies and districts, while Intel enables advanced spying actions.
4. **Espionage**: Send spies to enemy districts to gather information, sabotage resources, or execute covert operations. Be careful — enemies can spy on you too!

## The Five Rings of Sun Tzu
The core of the gameplay is based on mastering the "Five Divine Rings" from Sun Tzu’s philosophy, which are:

1. **Knowledge**: The art of intelligence and knowing the enemy's plans.
2. **Leadership**: Mastery of commanding armies and influencing the map.
3. **Force**: Raw power and control over resources.
4. **Timing**: Strategic decision-making and the importance of knowing when to act.
5. **Espionage**: Gaining an edge through subterfuge, sabotage, and misinformation.

## How to Play

1. **Start a Game**: Players are assigned a district at the beginning of the game. Use your resources wisely to grow your power.
2. **Turn-based Actions**: Spend AP to perform actions such as moving, spying, or attacking.
3. **Spy Network**: Place spies in enemy districts to sabotage them or gain valuable Intel.
4. **Victory**: Conquer the majority of districts or eliminate your enemies to claim victory.

## Development

- **Procedurally Generated Maps**: The game dynamically generates a new map at the start of every game, ensuring no two playthroughs are the same.
- **Dynamic Turn System**: Players take turns executing actions, exhausting their AP each round before passing to the next player.
- **Real-time UI Updates**: The game features real-time updates for district control, resource management, and espionage.
